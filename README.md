# 8088 Microcode

The 8088 was an Intel microprocessor that would power the home PC revolution. Here, I'm attempting to emulate an IBM 5150 PC at the microcode level

# What is microcode?
Microcode is used by CPUs to break down large instructions into smaller ones. It is comprised of many small programs run for every instruction, and it's why instructions can take many cycles

# THANKS
Many thanks to reengine for his work on reverse engineering the 8088's microcode, and to gloriouscow for assisting me in making it all make sense
